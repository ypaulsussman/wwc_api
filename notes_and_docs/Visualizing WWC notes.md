# Visualizing WWC

- Goal: make quantitative research more accessible/digestible to practitioners
- Make simple wwc reorganization; use as opportunity to learn hooks and more CSS
<!-- - **Next Steps:**
  - Get the numbers above; refresh your understanding of the other variables/tables/joins
  - Make three lists of interesting X:Y (bar chart, scatter plot) and X:Y:Z (multi-line graph) axes
  - Sketch widget to switch between the axes: t-chart w/ radio buttons? <Select> dropdowns? -->
