- `Note w/ tooltip about, like with % Non-Hispanic, data in complementary field frequently missing or adds up significantly less than 100%; rather than attempting to clean data from place of ignorance, working with what I have. Could - and, if requested, happy to - add filters for % Female and % Non-Hispanic: but at this stage worried already about analysis paralysis, selection overload; as such, elided them.`
- `Note w/ tooltip about why sorting by race isn't provided: data is messy, opaquely incomplete, and possibly misleading`
- `Note w/ tooltip about why Sites aren't present -- way too many` --also, title these 'placeholders'; make their font slightly different, and perhaps have the background explanation be a tooltip?
